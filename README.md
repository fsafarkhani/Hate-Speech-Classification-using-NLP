# ðŸ§  Hate Speech Detection using NLP (DistilBERT)

This project focuses on detecting **hate speech** and **offensive content** in tweets using both traditional and deep learning models.  
After cleaning and balancing the dataset with **SMOTE** and **data augmentation**, multiple models were trained â€”  
**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **DistilBERT (fine-tuned)** using Hugging Face Transformers.

ðŸ“Š **Results:**  
- DistilBERT achieved **90.1% test accuracy** â€” outperforming traditional ML models.  
- Balanced F1-scores across all classes (hate, offensive, neutral).  
- Applied TF-IDF, tokenization, and full preprocessing pipeline.

ðŸ’¡ Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, Transformers, and Hugging Face**.
